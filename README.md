## Backend

This API is built using Django Rest Framework.

One of the key features of this Ecommerce application is the integration with PayPal, which allows customers to make direct payments for digital files. This provides a convenient and secure payment option for customers, ensuring a seamless purchasing experience.

Furthermore, this application includes a unique feature where contributors can earn revenue for each purchase made by customers. When a customer buys a digital file, a portion of the payment goes to the contributor's wallet balance, increasing their earnings. This incentivizes contributors to share high-quality digital files and provides them with a source of income for their creative work.

Overall, this platform serves as a marketplace that connects contributors and customers, facilitating the sharing and selling of digital products. It streamlines the process for both contributors and customers, making it easy for contributors to monetize their work and for customers to access premium digital files.
