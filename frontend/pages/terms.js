                            <li>you allegedly register or register in any other person’s name as a MurstGraphics User again, directly or indirectly;</li>
                            <li>the information that you have provided is untruthful, inaccurate, outdated or incomplete;</li>

                        </ol>
                        Should your MurstGraphics Account be terminated, the account and transactional information that meet data retention standards will be securely stored for 5 years.

If MurstGraphics does lay down an administrative hold on some or all of your funds or MurstGraphics Account, MurstGraphics may continue such hold until such time as the dispute has been resolved and evidence of the resolution acceptable to MurstGraphics has been provided to MurstGraphics in a form acceptable to MurstGraphics. MurstGraphics will not involve itself in any such dispute or the resolution of the dispute. You agree that MurstGraphics will have no liability or responsibility for any such hold, or for your inability to withdraw Digital Assets or funds or execute trades during the period of any such hold.

                    <br/>
                    PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY, AS IT INVOLVES A WAIVER OF CERTAIN RIGHTS TO BRING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING AS A CLASS ACTION.
                        <span className='text-bold'><h5> Notice of Claim and Dispute Resolution Period.</h5></span>
                        . Please contact MurstGraphics first! MurstGraphics wants to address your concerns without resorting to formal legal proceedings, if possible. If you have a dispute with MurstGraphics, then you should contact MurstGraphics and a ticket number will be assigned. MurstGraphics will attempt to resolve your dispute internally as soon as possible. The parties agree to negotiate in good faith to resolve the dispute (which discussions shall remain confidential and be subject to applicable rules protecting settlement discussions from use as evidence in any legal proceeding).
                        <br/>
                        In the event the dispute cannot be resolved satisfactorily, and you wish to assert a legal claim against MurstGraphics, then you agree to set forth the basis of such claim in writing in a “Notice of Claim,” as a form of prior notice to MurstGraphics. The Notice of Claim must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, (2) set forth the specific relief sought, (3) provide the original ticket number, and (4) include your MurstGraphics account email. The Notice of Claim should be submitted to an email address or hyperlink provided in your correspondence with MurstGraphics. After you have provided the Notice of Claim to MurstGraphics, the dispute referenced in the Notice of Claim may be submitted by either MurstGraphics or you to arbitration in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Section, below. For the avoidance of doubt, the submission of a dispute to MurstGraphics for resolution internally and the delivery of a Notice of Claim to MurstGraphics are prerequisites to commencement of an arbitration proceeding (or any other legal proceeding). During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or MurstGraphics shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator.
